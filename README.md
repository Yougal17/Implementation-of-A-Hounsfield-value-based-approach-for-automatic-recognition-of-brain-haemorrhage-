# Implementation-of-A-Hounsfield-value-based-approach-for-automatic-recognition-of-brain-haemorrhage

The research paper "A Hounsfield value-based approach for automatic recognition of brain haemorrhage" outlines a method to automatically detect, diagnose, and classify brain haemorrhages using Hounsfield Unit (HU) values derived from CT/MRI DICOM images. The method avoids the limitations of previous approaches by directly processing DICOM images to retain useful information and applies a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for classification.

I have tried to make the implementation as easy as possible.
